# ctrl+alt+l
It's possible while I have a separate alt key but would be hard if alt is
hidden.

# ctrl+alt+delete
Pretty difficult atm.

# L1
A dedicated L1 key under the thumb would be nice. Or if not dedicated, at
least not a key that needs to be held ever.

# Swap
Currently don't have a swap on the left half, which is probably where I need
it.

# Leader key
Need to try this under the thumb when I have a key available.
