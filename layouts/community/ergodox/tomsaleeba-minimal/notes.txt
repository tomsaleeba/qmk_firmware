# Swap
Currently don't have a swap on the left half, which is probably where I need
it.

# Leader key
Need to try this under the thumb when I have a key available.

# win + enter
Currently can't do it because the gui key is on the same key

# 5 col layout
- control and shift both need to be controlled by thumb or little finger so
  control+shift+<blah> can be done.
- tab can't be on the same key as control or shift otherwise you can't go
  backwards through things
- control needs to be on the left so I can one-handed copypasta
- I need to be able to control+home,end,etc so I need to be able to hit the
  layer switch to bring the keys at the same time as control.
- I need to be able to hit tab at the same as control, and ideally shift too
- need a home for tab,shift,control,\,|,=,+,-,_,',". So 3 on the base layer and 8 on
  the other layers. Parenthesis can give up their spot on the number layer and
  live just with the other brackets.
