I need permissive hold and ignore_mod_tap_interrupt for the shift keys,
but that some config ruins me being able to share a letter or any other key
that I might hit rapidly with a modifier. I'm struggling where to put alt for
the crkbd layout I'm trying to emulate.

The tap dance macro I have for the F key works but the repeated keys don't show
instantly and it's annoying. So I'm not using it. Maybe I need to lower the
TAPPING_TERM value and see how that goes? I can't think of a key on the left
half that won't ever be double tapped. I can probably live without single key
for ctrl+shift+arrows.

# backspace/L1
Works ok but when I go to backspace a bunch of text, the initial hold gets
weird. It needs a double tap.
